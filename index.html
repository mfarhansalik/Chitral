    The summer of 2015 was a very special one for me. Like all Highschool
    juniors, I was excited to enter my Senior Year. Not only that, I was
    chosen to represent Pakistan at the
    <a href="http://asc2015.posn.or.th/">Asian Science Camp</a>. For a Physics
    Major, this was a dream come true. Little did I know that I would come
    back a completely different person. At ASC, I realise how being a
    scientist was not the career move I wanted to make. Rather, I was more
    interested and far more talented in the Entrepreneurial aspect of building
    new products. ASC changed my mind and that is where I first heard about
    <a href="https://www.babson.edu/">Babson College</a>. I ended up dropping
    all my Engineering focused schools from the Common App and applied to
    Babson as my first and only choice. After a month of sending in my
    application, I was accepted and thus began my journey as a Beaver.
    <br>
  <p>During my time at Babson, I took part in multiple events and organizations that made me grow both personally and
    professionally. I joined AMAN in my freshman year. AMAN is one of Babson's largest organizations with almost 200
    members active. AMAN represents the South Asian community at Babson which amounts for almost 10&#37 of the entire
    student body. While AMAN is active throughout the year, its presence is really felt during the months of April and
    November when the Organizations hosts the AMAN Show in Sorenson Theatre. The AMAN Show is an opportunity for the
    widely diverse student body at Babson to come into close contact with the rich culture of South Asia. From
    showcasing a play, dancing the night out and hosting the best dinner of the semester, AMAN does it all. During my
    time at Babson, I took part in all the shows organized by the organization. </p>
  <p>Apart from AMAN, I was an Admission Fellow at the Admissions Office, Executive Assistant to the President, Spark
    Tutor for Economics, Babson Summer Study Mentor and an Assistant for the Payroll Department. I was also given the
    opportunity to go to HEC Paris as an Exchange Student in the fall semester of 2018. At HEC, I thoroughly enjoyed the
    European University Culture. At HEC, I took part in a Model United Nations Conference after 5 years. MUNs had been a
    passion for me since High School yet I never got the opportunity at Babson. I was awarded the Best Delegate award in
    the Security Council.</p>
  <p>I returned from Paris with not only fond memories but a startup that I had founded during my exchange semester. I
    spent the next couple of months building a mobile platform that could solve one of the biggest problems faced by
    shippers in Pakistan. I also ended up joining Phi Gamma Nu at Babson. Phi Gamma Nu was the newest business
    fraternity on campus. I went on to become the President of Phi Gamma Nu the following year. </p>
  <p>At Babson I have learned the art of Entrepreneurship over the course of
    the past 4 years. I have ventured into different industries and have
    experienced both success and failure. I aspire to learn from these
    experiences and translate them into valuables lessons for myself and all
    the other entrepreneurs that I meet in the time to come&#33 As I am currently working at a Venture Capital Firm, I
    hope to make it come true very soon.</p>

    Apart from looking at new and upcoming startups on

    and potentially fight over Football. I am a huge

    around the Back Bay region in Boston.
