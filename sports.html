            <p>Shandur is situated at an altitude of 12,500 feet (38000 meters) above sea level is famous for having the highest polo ground of world.
                It is sometimes called Roof of the World. The version of polo game played in Shandur Polo Ground is considered to be the purist of all.
                It is also called free style polo. Polo is the most favorite game in Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan. Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, Shigar, Laspor,
                Mastoj, Chitral and all other valleys around must have at least one polo ground, where local people can be seen playing polo. Shandur Polo Ground is
                naturally designed to be a polo ground. Small hills are on all four sides of rectangular ground, where spectators can sit and enjoy the match.
                The surrounding landscape and Shandur Lake makes it even more beautiful.The beautiful polo ground of Shandur turns into a city of tents each year
                in July due to the Shandur Polo Festival.</p></div>

        <div class="twobythree"><h4>Football in Chitral</h4>
            <p>Chitral is full of talent when it comes to Football. There are 3-4 players in the Pakistan National Team at all times that are from Chitral. Each year, the District government hosts a major tournament which is played by 36 teams from across the valley. In every major city of Pakistan, there is a Chitral FC registered for people from Chitrali origin to play competitive games away from home. Due to the climate, lack of transportation options and poverty levels, the regular Chitrali kid grows up walking miles for school, gathering wood and traversing the mountains daily. This is one of the reasons CHitrali football players can outrun any other player on the field. Despite lack of opportunities, the locals manage to come together and play the beautiful game. Recently, there have been initiatives to promote female football in the valley as well. Sports scholarships are a great way to make it to good universities for Chitrali kids since there are already very few higher education opportunities within the valley. The crowds are passionate, the players give their all and everyone in the valley seems to not miss out on Football no matter what the conditions.</p></div>
