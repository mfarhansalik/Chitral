            <div class="twobythree"><h4>Origins</h4>
                <p>Chitral's history has the marks of many civilizations. Some even believe that Alexander The Great left behind a small portion of his army in Chitral which eventually took the shape of the Kalasha Tribe. However, not much is documented from that time. The remnants of various cultures, religions and civilizations can be found in Chitral. The drawings of Stupas on some rocks from the early ages even suggest that Chitral was part of the Kushan Empire. While very little can be accurately deciphered, the origin of the Kho Chitrali can be traced to the villages of Mulkhow and Torkhow.</p>

            <div class="twobythree"><h4>Katoor Dynasty</h4>
                <p>It is recorded that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katoor_dynasty"></a> Katoor Dynasty was established in Chitral in 1570. The Katoor family ruled Chitral till 1947, after which Chitral became a dominion of Pakistan. The Katoor's influence did not stop at Chitral but expanded all across the land all the way to Kashmir. The size of Mehtar Aman Ul Mulk's empire was so great that it would amount upto 40% of the entirety of Northern Pakistan. The title of "Ul Mulk" was given to the members of the Katoor family to signify them as royalty. While the empire was massive, the people of Chitral were massively deprived of opportunity under the rule of the Katoor Dynasty. With time, the Katoors became very lavish in their spending, starting fighting amongst each other for the throne and soon the collapse was eminent. Then came the wrath of the British Empire which appointed their own champion on the throne. Fortunately for the Katoors , the British did not have any major interests in the foothills of the HinduKush apart from stopping any Russian advancement and Chitral was left under the rule of the Mehtar even though homage was paid to the Viceroy in Delhi.</p></div>
