            <p>Chitral is famous for many of its offerings to tourists. However, none stands out as much as the Kalasha. The Kalasha are a tribe that live in the valleys of Birir, Rumboor and Bomburet. They trace their roots all the way back to Alexander The Great himself. They are greek in origin and have been living in the HinduKush practicing their customs; completely untouched by the rest of the world. They are known for some of the most unorthodox practices. They celebrate death and consider it a liberation. They bury their dead with food, clothing and a weapon among many other things that are considered to be essential for their journey to the afterlife. They are very joyous in nature and live very simple lives. They have garnered fame across the world for being one of the most well preserved ancient cultures. Every year, there are three major Kalash Festivals. The one with the most attendance is Chilam Joshi (Spring Festival) which attracts tourists from both inside Pakistan and across the globe. It is a joyous occasion and there is dance and music everywhere. Unlike other Chitralis, the Kalasha have their own language as well. It is estimated that only 4100 people remain in the world of direct Kalash origins.  </p></div>

            <p> Chitral Valley is one of the very few places in the world which offers exotic cultural retreats as well as stunning mountain sceneries. It is the perfect blend of peace and chaos. The rough terrain makes it difficult for the average tourist to access this paradise. This has greatly helped in preservation of the local culture. Chitral has many sights to offer and many places to relax. One just needs to decide what they are looking for! For the adventurous we have the Shandur Polo Festival, the Golen Gol National Park and the 40+ peaks that climb over 6000 meters. Check this video for inspiration incase you are planning your own trip!</p></div>
