            <div class="pad20"><img src="images/markhor-1.jpg" alt="Markhor" width="100%">
                <p>The Markhor is considered to be royalty amongst all mountain goats. Weighing over 250 pounds, these goats are few in number but can be easily sighted in Chitral. There are numerous places along the Chitral River where you can spot Markhors come down from the peaks to enjoy a quick fill of cold water before heading back into their mountainous castles. The Wildlife Department in Chitral is very strict with regards to the conservation of the Markhor population. It is also the national animal of Pakistan. Once in a blue moon, a license is given to hunt a markhor by the government. These licenses cost upwards of $150,000 USD. The money is used to replenish the budget of the Wildlife department along with improvements to the local community. Hunting Markhor is strictly prohibited.</p></div>

        <div class="onebythree"><div><h4>Snow Leopard</h4></div>
            <div class="pad20"><img src="images/snow-leopard.jpg" alt="Shandur Polo Festival" width="100%">
                <p>Pakistan is one of the very few countries in the world where this beautiful cat can be sighted. It is estimated that there are around 500 snow leopards in Pakistan. Chitral is famous for Snow Leopard sightings. During the winter months when the snow levels reach out to the valley floor, it is not uncommon for a brief snow leopard sighting. Extreme measures are taken by the government and international protection bodies to make sure that these leopards do not have to face any captivity and neither can they be hunted for sport. Currently, there are around 5000-6000 Snow Leopards left in the world. Chitral is blessed to be home to almost 400 of them. Changing climatic conditions have made it hard for these Snow Leopards to survive unfortunately.</p></div>

        <div class="onebythree"><div><h4>Martial Falcon</h4></div>
            <div class="pad20"><img src="images/falcon.jpg" alt="Chitral Terrain" width="100%">
                <p>The Martial Falcon is truly a the queen of all birds. Famous for her speed, vision and strength, she is the ideal bird to have with you when going for a hunt. Throughout Chitral's history, falconry has been extremely close to the culture. Until just some decades ago, the people of the entire village would gather every night for a month to celebrate and train a new falcon when it was caught. Some Tourists come solely for falconry and pay very high amounts for the experience. Chitral is famous for its falcons and the King of Chitral once even gifted a falcon to the King of Saudi Arabia himself. The King of Saudi Arabia sent his own private plane to have it picked up, While falconry is not entirely legal, it continues to be part of the culture. However, it is very less prevalent in the younger generations.</p></div>
